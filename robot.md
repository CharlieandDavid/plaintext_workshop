# Methods

Participants grasped the handle of an IMT2 two degree of freedom robot (InMotion Technologies Inc.) as they reached from a start position to a movement target, located 20 cm away. The robot applied a velocity-dependent force to the hand during movement, according to [@eq:forcefield].

$$
    F_{x} = k \left[ v_{y} \right]
$$ {#eq:forcefield}

In [@eq:forcefield], $x$ and $y$ are lateral and sagittal directions, $F_{x}$ is the applied robot force in the left-right direction, $v_{y}$ is hand velocity in the forward-backward direction and $k$=14 Ns/m.
